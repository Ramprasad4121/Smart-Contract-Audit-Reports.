Introduction:

As a passionate smart contract auditor, I have completed extensive training in smart contract security, including a 20-hour course by Patrick Collins. This repository contains audit reports that highlight my ability to identify and mitigate security risks in smart contracts.

Audit Reports:

Each folder in this repository contains the audit report for a specific smart contract. The reports include a detailed analysis of the contract, the vulnerabilities found, and recommendations for remediation.

Available Reports:

	2.	PuppyRaffle-report.pdf
	3.	T-SWAP-Report.pdf
	4.	Thunder_Loan_Report.pdf

Methodology

The following steps outline my typical audit process:

	1.	Code Review: Thoroughly review the smart contract code to understand its functionality and logic.
	2.	Static Analysis: Use automated tools to perform a static analysis of the code to identify common vulnerabilities.
	3.	Manual Analysis: Manually inspect the code to identify subtle and complex vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss.
	4.	Testing: Deploy the smart contract in a test environment and conduct various tests to evaluate its behavior under different scenarios.
	5.	Reporting: Compile a detailed report that includes the identified vulnerabilities, their severity, potential impact, and recommendations for remediation.

Tools Used

	•	Slither: A static analysis framework for smart contracts.
	•	Oyente: An analysis tool for finding security vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts.
 	•	Foundry: A blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
	•	Remix IDE: An online tool for writing, testing, and debugging smart contracts.
	•	Ganache: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development used to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests.
