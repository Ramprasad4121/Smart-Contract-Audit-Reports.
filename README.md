Introduction:

As a passionate smart contract auditor, I have completed extensive training in smart contract security, including a 20-hour course by Patrick Collins. This repository contains audit reports that highlight my ability to identify and mitigate security risks in smart contracts.

Audit Reports:

Each folder in this repository contains the audit report for a specific smart contract. The reports include a detailed analysis of the contract, the vulnerabilities found, and recommendations for remediation.


Methodology

The following steps outline my typical audit process:

	1.	Code Review: Thoroughly review the smart contract code to understand its functionality and logic.
	2.	Static Analysis: Use automated tools to perform a static analysis of the code to identify common vulnerabilities.
	3.	Manual Analysis: Manually inspect the code to identify subtle and complex vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss.
	4.	Testing: Deploy the smart contract in a test environment and conduct various tests to evaluate its behavior under different scenarios.
	5.	Reporting: Compile a detailed report that includes the identified vulnerabilities, their severity, potential impact, and recommendations for remediation.
